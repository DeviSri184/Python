"""
A heap queue or priority queue is a data structure that allows us to quickly access the smallest (min-heap) or 
largest (max-heap) element. A heap is typically implemented as a binary tree, where each parent nodeâ€™s value is smaller 
(for a min-heap) or larger (for a max-heap) than its children. However, in Python, heaps are usually implemented as min-heaps 
which means the smallest element is always at the root of the tree, making it easy to access.
Heap is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node. 
Then it is called a Min Heap. If each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node then it is called a max heap

A heap is created by simply using a list of elements with the heapify function and the heapify function rearranges
the elements bringing the smallest element to the first position

# Replace an element
"""
The heap replace function always removes the smallest element of the heap and inserts the new incoming element at some place not fixed by any order.
heapq.heapreplace() function is a combination of pop and push. It pops the smallest element from the heap and inserts a new element into the heap

This function allows us to push an element onto the heap and pop the smallest element in one combined operation.

print(h) # [10, 20, 15, 30, 40] ==> Element 5 is appended to the heap using heappush(). Then, heappop() is used to remove the smallest element (5), which was just added.

# Merge Operation
"""
heapq.merge() function is used to merge multiple sorted iterables into a single sorted heap. It returns an iterator over the sorted values, which we can then iterate through.
